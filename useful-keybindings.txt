TODOs/wants:

move selected block up and down
move up down methods
move to next diagnostic/match (from search) globally
sneak
something with parenthesis matching maybe? maybe not?
run configurations/run bash command
terminal integration, maybe with tmux? (harpoon probably)
select all shortcut
setup system clipboard yanking
search files in project, not entire system
recently open files would be nice
recent locations? BIG maybe
check more mini.nvim things
check more included snacks
maaaaaaybe something about registers?
sometime check multiple buffers
biiiig if: expand selection -> kind of sexy but kinda defeats the purpose of vim?
multicursor!!!
