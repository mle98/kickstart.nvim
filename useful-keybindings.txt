miscellanious
in undo history (leader su) you can actually copy the diff as a 'patch' with C-y
with mini.ai, you can do stuff like v2i" to select the second next occurence of matching quotes
with mini.ai, you can use 'f' for function calls like yaf
mini.ai has q as synonym to quote, and b for brackets, a for text object, F for function definitions,l/n can be used for next and last
